# Annual Energy Consumption for Refrigerator

Refrigerators are one of the most commonly used appliances in the household and has the commercial applications too. Refrigerators can account for as much as one-sixth of all electricity used in the average home. With the increase in energy consumption the latest devices are producing, Manufacturers are now concerned with the rise in energy consumption of the Refrigerators and wine chillers.

The aim is to analyze the annual energy consumption of the appliance “Refrigerator” with different attributes. The datasets contain different brand, models, and other attributes of the refrigerator and respective yearly energy consumption (KWh/year). The data has been
modelled separately for refrigerators and wine chillers using 5 models and finding the one which explains the data best and also is practically suitable.

The key findings of our analysis suggest that the freezer location and defrost mechanism play and essential role in designing energy efficient refrigerators. This report aims at making some actionable recommendations to the manufacturer who can make an appropriate decision while developing the energy-efficient refrigerator models.

Questions:

1. Which type of Defrost Mechanism works best for a refrigerator according to the volume, fridge location?
2. Is there a corelation between the location of the fridge and the energy consumed?

Data Sources:

The data is collected from Energy Consumption - Government of Canada. The dataset includes 17 data attributes, and it contains various model number under the brands along with other respective attributes. The data provided in the report needed to be clean accordingly, and we removed redundant values.
